# ` How can OpenSea quickly determine which NFTs an address owns if most NFTs donâ€™t use ERC721 enumerable? Explain how you would accomplish this if you were creating an NFT marketplace`
- I assume OpenSea listens to and indexes the NFT contract event logs. When an NFT is transferred, the ERC721 standard requires the emission of a Transfer event. By indexing these events, OpenSea can build a database of which addresses own which NFTs.
- I would adopt the same approach as OpenSea. If storage constraints are an issue, I would query the on-chain data to retrieve the most recent transfer event for a specific NFT, rather than indexing all events from the smart contract. It displays the current owner, though not the complete transaction history. However, if a user wishes to view the full history, I would then utilize the regular approach of indexing all the data for that particular NFT.
