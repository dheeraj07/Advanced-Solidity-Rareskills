# `What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves.`
## ERC777:

1. ERC777 introduces hook mechanism, which will enable to execute the custom code upon receving/sending tokens. Unlike ERC-20, ERC-777 can prevent tokens from being permanently lost when sent to contracts that don’t support them. If a contract doesn’t implement the necessary hooks, the transaction can be reverted, avoiding accidental losses.
   
2. ERC-777 combines the approval and transfer steps of ERC-20 into a single transaction with its send function, simplifying the user experience. This reduces the two-step process (approve, then transfer) to just one step.
   
3.  It allows token holders to authorize operators to move tokens on their behalf. Unlike ERC-20's approval mechanism, ERC-777's operator mechanism does not inherently include a token limit. Once authorized, an operator can transfer any amount of the token holder's tokens, up to the holder's total balance.
   
4. ERC-777 maintains compatibility with ERC-20 methods along with new and improved methods like `send`.

## ERC1363:

1. ERC-1363 is also similar to ERC777 and it introduces callback functions that are triggered for two separate actions: approval (approveAndCall) and transfer (transferAndCall).

2. ERC-1363 is particularly useful in scenarios where an immediate action is required following a token transfer or approval


# `Why was ERC1363 introduced, and what issues are there with ERC777?`

1. ERC-777 introduces several advanced features that represent a significant evolution from the traditional ERC-20 standard. These include the operators concept, the send function, and hooks concept. These features collectively change the methodology of token transfer, making ERC-777 more complex than ERC-20.

2. ERC-1363 was introduced as an extension of the ERC-20 standard, providing additional functionalities while maintaining the core simplicity of ERC-20. It is suitable for scenarios where there is a need for executing custom actions upon transfer or approval of tokens, without the need to adopt the more complex features of ERC-777. ERC-1363 adds transferAndCall and approveAndCall methods that enable contracts to execute additional logic immediately after a token transfer or approval, making it ideal for applications that require simple enhancements to the ERC-20 standard.
